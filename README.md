  - Or try [different approaches](https://betterexplained.com/articles/navigate-a-grid-using-combinations-and-permutations/)
- **Problem 18/67** - It uses Dynamic Programming (breaking problem into subproblems)
  - See [these approaches](https://www.mathblog.dk/project-euler-18/), also see [optimal substructures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_substructure), graph theory and greedy algorithms.


#### Notes

- Some exercises used typescript/ts-node, hence the packages.json
- Some JS/TS files use IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) to avoid function and variable collision
